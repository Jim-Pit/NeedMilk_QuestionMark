# NeedMilk_QuestionMark

This app represents a simple system where we can keep track of a customer's pending orders.
We can register new customers and new orders that relate to a customer and need to be served.
After an order has been served, it can be deleted.
Entity Framework is used to define a one-to-many relationship between a Customer and his pending Orders.
